    "# Why Expose A Model As API?\n",
    "\n",
    "R is widely used for data science and deploying models into production. The end users are typically IT and enterprise software that need to consume solutions that can be easily integrated with their software.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can replicate the code into other programming languages used widely around the world by software developers but here lies the problem - Majority of the programming languages do not have libraries to perform ML!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "So one good solution is to expose the model as API. The most common type of API is REST/RESTful API. REST APIs allow two applications each other over the Internet using HTTP as their protocol. In simpler terms, they deliver the requests from client to the server (specified in the URL) and then deliver the responses (as requested in the method - GET, PUT, POST) back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exposing the R Model as API, we can let other applications to use model for the purposes it is designed for without worrying abut the underlying environment/architecture."

If it finds one, that endpoint is invoked and the value returned by the endpoint is returned as response. If no endpoint is available to process the request, the standard HTTP error 404 is returned.
